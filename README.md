# COS285Lab4

Lab 4 for COS285
Authors: Christopher Brown, Chris A, Nicolas Borelli

The coding segment for this lab went smoothly, but trying to figure out a new platform in five hours is not easy.
Additionally, not all machines are created equally. Things that might work on one machine may not work on another.

To run our program, you may need to download the .java AND .class files aswell. Then it is as simple as just java COS285Lab4.Lab4 data.txt
